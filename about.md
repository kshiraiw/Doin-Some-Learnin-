<p>Hi! I am a software engineer living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have done several projects using the MEAN stack and I am constantly impressed with the cool things I can do with new frameworks.</p><p>In my former life I was a special education teacher, making me especially great at getting along with a lot of different types of people. :) In my spare time, I like to find delicious food, read, listen to podcasts, and I have also formed a close personal relationship with Netflix.</p>
