I think that it is fitting that my first post on the Jekyll platform should be about Jekyll...

So I began my adventures with Jekyll by watching the tutorials on [Treehouse](<http://teamtreehouse.com>). I was able to finish the first portion of the videos during my lunch break and I was super psyched to be able to try it when I got home. Seemed simple enough.

I opened my terminal and I typed in "gem install jekyll". Permissions error.. Oh well, the Treehouse tutorials told me that it was expected and I can type in "sudo gem install jekyll". Yay! The terminal said it was installed. Awesome! Now on to start my blog, right? I typed in "jekyll new ....". Command Not Found.... hmm... that's strange... 

It took me the better part of an hour to google and harass the hubby to find out the answer. Sometimes the littlest things can cause the most frustration....

rbenv vs rvm?? Sounds like a bunch of gibberish to me. The hubby told me to type in "chmod" to override the permissions error so I can install using "gem install jekyll" rather than sudo. Success!

I'm never satisfied with just the copy/paste so I wanted to know why the tutorial didn't work. The hubby was no help. When I asked what the difference was between rbenv and rvm his reply was "rbenv is just better." Hmm.... So after further googling I learned that rbenv is a method of compiling ruby and its accompanying gems. If you sudo install something, rbenv breaks because it doesn't know where to find the gem. 

I know this might sound obvious to people in the field but to me, it makes me feel better to learn more techy jargon. So there... Lesson learned!
